## 📖 Overview
This repository is structured into **four key milestones**, focusing on:

✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and data preprocessing.

✅ **Containerization and database integration** using Docker, PostgreSQL, and Kafka.

✅ **Scalable data cleaning and transformation** with Apache Spark.

✅ **End-to-end ETL pipeline and dashboard visualization** using Apache Airflow and Plotly.

Each milestone introduces **real-world data engineering scenarios** to build a strong foundation for handling large-scale data processing tasks.

## 📊 Milestones

### 🏆 Milestone 1: EDA, Data Cleaning, and Feature Engineering
#### Objectives:
✔ Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to extract insights from raw data.

✔ Clean and preprocess data by handling **missing values and inconsistencies**.

✔ Apply **feature engineering** techniques for better model performance.

✔ Develop **lookup tables** to facilitate encoding and future transformations.

---

### 🏆 Milestone 2: Data Packaging, Storage, and Streaming
#### Objectives:
✔ **Containerize the project** using **Docker** for streamlined deployment.

✔ Store processed data in:
   - **PostgreSQL** for structured data storage.
   - **Local storage (CSV/Parquet)** for easy file access.
     
✔ Implement **real-time data streaming** using **Kafka**, enabling real-time processing and database integration.

---

### 🏆 Milestone 3: Advanced Data Cleaning and Analysis
#### Objectives:
✔ Process large-scale datasets using **Apache Spark**.

✔ Perform **deep data cleaning**, including:
   - **Renaming columns** for consistency.
   - **Handling missing values** systematically.
     
✔ Enhance the dataset with **advanced feature engineering**.

✔ Encode categorical columns and store them in:
   - **Local files (CSV/Parquet)**.
   - **PostgreSQL database** (bonus feature).

---

### 🏆 Milestone 4: ETL Pipeline and Dashboard
#### Objectives:
✔ Develop an **automated ETL pipeline** using **Apache Airflow** to streamline data processing workflows.

✔ Design an **interactive dashboard** using **Plotly**, providing real-time insights into processed data.
